# Script Evaluation through AI

An AI-Based Script Evaluation System that automates the assessment of descriptive answer scripts using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Manual evaluation of descriptive answer scripts is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistencies.  
This project provides an AI-assisted solution that helps teachers evaluate answer scripts efficiently while maintaining fairness and transparency.

The system extracts text from scanned answer scripts, segments answers question-wise, evaluates responses using semantic similarity, and generates explainable feedback. Teacher validation is supported to ensure reliability.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate evaluation of descriptive answer scripts  
- Reduce manual correction effort for teachers  
- Provide consistent and explainable scoring  
- Compare AI-generated scores with teacher scores  
- Generate detailed feedback and reports

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI  
- **OCR Engines:** Tesseract OCR, EasyOCR  
- **NLP Models:** Sentence Transformers  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Upload scanned answer scripts (PDF/Image)  
2. Extract text using OCR  
3. Segment answers using predefined question schema  
4. Perform NLP-based semantic evaluation  
5. Generate AI scores and error rates  
6. Compare with teacher-assigned marks  
7. Generate feedback and evaluation reports

## 👩‍🏫 Use Case

This system acts as a **decision-support tool for teachers**, not a replacement.  
Final evaluation authority remains with the educator.
